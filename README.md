   - I used `File` > `Open Folder` to open a project folder.

3. **Navigating Files/Directories**:
   - I used `Ctrl+P` to quickly open files by typing part of the filename.
   - I used breadcrumbs in the editor to navigate folders.

### Settings and Preferences

#### Customizing Settings

3. **Added Breakpoints**:
   - I clicked in the gutter next to the line number where I wanted to pause execution.

4. **Started Debugging**:
   - I clicked the green play button in the debug view or pressed `F5`.

#### Key Debugging Features

- **Breakpoints**: I paused execution at specific lines.
- **Watch Variables**: I monitored variable values.
- **Call Stack**: I viewed the call stack at any point in execution.
- **Step Through Code**: I stepped into, over, and out of functions.

### Using Source Control

#### Integrating Git with VS Code

1. **Initialized a Repository**:
   - I opened the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or using `Ctrl+Shift+G`.
